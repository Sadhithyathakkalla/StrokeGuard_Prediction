StrokeGuard Prediction
Overview
StrokeGuard Prediction is an AI-driven project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a stroke occurrence based on patient data. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze key health indicators and provide reliable predictions, potentially assisting healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention.

Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Utilized various techniques to collect, clean, and preprocess medical datasets for accurate model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to uncover patterns and correlations in the data, aiding in feature selection.
Feature Engineering: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones to improve model accuracy.
Model Building and Evaluation: Employed multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, to build and evaluate predictive models.
Model Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
Technologies Used
Python: Core language for development.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation.
Streamlit: For deploying the model as a web app.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For iterative development and experimentation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains medical records of patients, including features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level,Marital Status,Working Type and BMI.

Results
The best-performing model, Random Forest, achieved an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 99 on the test dataset. The model was evaluated using cross-validation to ensure generalizability.
